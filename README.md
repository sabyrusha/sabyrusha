## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**sabyrusha/sabyrusha** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a responsive Kropp Fitness website using HTML & CSS, with a focus on accessibility and performance.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and TypeScript by building practice projects and exploring component-driven development.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on front-end projects that involve responsive design and modern web practices.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving code architecture and learning how to scale front-end applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about responsive web design, semantic HTML, and clean CSS architecture.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Telegram @sabyrusha](https://t.me/sabyrusha) or [email me](mailto:sabyrusha@gmail.com)
