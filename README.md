I'm a **Frontend Developer** passionate about creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.

Currently honing my skills in **React** and **TypeScript**, working on real projects and writing structured, maintainable code.

Iâ€™m eager to join a product team where I can contribute, learn from experienced developers, and grow as an engineer.
